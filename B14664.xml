            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING spent some time in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Sacred Passion of Christ, I find it to be a Sea in which is no bottome, a bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Sea of Charitie, a bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Sea of Mercie, a bottomlesse Sea of Grace, a bottomlesse Sea
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:177141:7"/> of Iustice, a bottomlesse Sea of Sorrow. I find it also to be a wood in which one may loose himselfe, though neuer to his losse; a Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth or Maze in which one may sooner finde a way to get in, then to get out, yet shall neuer be out of his way; yea a Garden of such varietie of sweete and odoriferous flowers, that one can neuer gather all; hardlie can he determine where to make his first choice, yet can neuer choose amisse. VVherefore (Gentle Reader) I will not promise thee to exhaust or drawe drye this Sea for thee; I should promise an impossibilitie; onelie I will drawe out of it as much as my weake forces will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and thine and my capacitie can receaue: Nor will I shew thee all the wayes, and windings of this wood and Maze, onelie I will bring thee into some few walkes,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:177141:7"/> which I my selfe haue passed; nor will I gather, nor can I, all the Flowers of this Garden; onelie I will select such as were obuious to me, and of which I my selfe haue smelled; and I will of them make a posie or nosegay for thee to smell on by deuout Meditation. Thou shalt find as many diuerse smelles in this Posie, as it conteineth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Flowers. Some will smell of Christ his great Charitie in suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring so much for mans Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; some will sauour of his Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in paying so full a price for the sayd Redemption; some will smell of his great Patience, some of his obedience to his Eternall Father, some of his great Humilitie, in that, <hi>he humbled him selfe, made obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient vnto death, euen the death</hi> of <hi>the Crosse.</hi> In breefe there is no vertue of which in this Posie thou mayst not haue an odoriferous and gratefull smell, if thou apply thy
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:177141:8"/> internall senses vnto it. Diuers of the Saints of God tooke such pleasure, consolation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in meditating vpon Christ his Passion, that in regard of it, they contemned all the pleasures which the world could afford. And yet I entitle this my Pamphlet, a Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhine Posie, because Christ his Dolours and Sorrowes were bitter as Myrrhe to him; though to vs they be most comfortable, because in them we contemplate his great loue and Charitie in suffering for vs; in them we behold the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full price of our Redemption; and because I desire that not onelie Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rholikes, but also Protestants, and all they who goe by the name of Christians should reade this Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, and take some benefit by it, I abstaine from all Controuersies in Religion, that none may be deterred from reading it. Take
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:177141:8"/> this my labour in good part, for it was vndertaken for thee; and if thou reape any good by reading it, thanke him who is Goodnes it self, and the Prime Cause, and principall Authour of all that is good; I was but his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weldie Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Some may say, why should I loue my Enemie, who is so contrarie to me? I answer, because Christ commaundeth; because Christ, and many his seruants haue giuen thee the example, and for many other reasons: For first euerie li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creature loueth his like, &amp; those
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:177141:90"/> of the same Kind? Secondlie they who are ordained to one end, and are of the same profession, as Soldiers, Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, Schollers, do loue one an other; and why should not we loue euen our Enemie, who professeth Christ with vs, and who is ordained to the same end with vs, to wit, life euerlasting? And how absurd should we think it to hate our enemie, with whom per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce we shall liue hereafter in all blisse and felicitie, yea and charitie also, for euer? Thirdlie, if our enemie were not to beloued for himself, yet he were for Gods sake, who created him, conserueth him, and causeth the rayne to rayne on him; the sunne to shine on him: yet he were for Christ his sake, who dyed for him, and prayed for him on the Crosse. Fourthlie, we should rather compassionat our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie then hate him, because his hatred is his greatest miserie, and hurteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self more then vs, when, be hateth. Fiftlie, when a mad man, or a possessed person doth strike vs, we take it pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientlie, because we imagine that it is not so much he, as his Phrenesie or the Diuell, who mooueth him, that stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:177141:91"/> vs. And why should we be angrie and in hatred towards our enemie, seeing that it is not so much he that wrongeth vs, as his phrenesie of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or the Diuell who mooueth him? Sixtlie, if you could not be reuenged of your enemie, nor could giue him a wound, but by first running your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and your owne bodie through with the sword, you would spare him: Seeing then you can not hurt your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie in his bodie or riches, but you must first hurt yourselfe in soule and spirituallie; seeing you can not hurt him, but with hurt, yea and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your owne soule, spare your enemies, loue them also, at least for loue of your owne soules. Seuenthlie, our enemies are indeed our greatest friends, and so are most to be beloued; for they obseruing our actions, to take aduantage against vs, do make vs warie, circumspect, and heedie; and they giue vs matter of patience and merit, and therefore the Martyrs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued more good of the persecuting Tyrant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:177141:91"/> yet that euill mind did no hurt to them. Eightlie, why do we hate our enemie but for his hatred of vs? For otherwise we would loue him. Hate then his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and kill his malice, not him; and seeing that malice and hatred is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by his contrarie, which is loue and charitie, and good turnes; let vs loue him and do good vnto him; so we shall extinguish his hatred towards vs, and make him of an enemie, a fast friend. Ninthlie, why do we perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute our enemie but to ouercome him? Beare patientlie the wrongs he doth you, and you ouercome him; for if you take them impatientlie, he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth you, and is master of you. Lastlie, let vs herein imitate almightie God; none hateth sinne more then he, yet he loueth the person of the sinner. It is true that God punisheth vs in this life, but not out of hatred of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but out of loue of them, meaning thereby to amend vs, and to induce vs to true repentance: as Physitions giue bitter potions to their patients, not to torment them, but to cure them of their ague; and as Surgeous launce and cut, onelie to heale the wound.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The first cause of this complaint was, because, although he suffered ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiuelie in other partes of his bodie, yet what he suffered in other partes (as in his head hands, and feete) was easilie seene of others, but what he suffered in his tongue by thirst, he onely felt, others could not see; and so that the spectatours of his Passion might know, that he suffered also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremlie in his tongue by thirst, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth of it particularlie.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The second cause of this his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint was the excessiuenes of his thirst, which peraduenture was so great, that it was the greatest torment he suffered. For as, peraduenture, there is no tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment greater then extreame famine &amp; thirst, so it is likelie his thirst was the greatest of all thirsts. He was afflicted with two thirsts, the one corporall of the tongue, the other spirituall of the soule. And Imagine (ô my soule) how
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:177141:109"/> excessiue his corporall thirst must needs be. The night before he was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, he slept not a winke, nor did he rest at all, but was drawne and haled from the Garden of <hi>Gethsemanie</hi> to <hi>Anna</hi> his house, from him to <hi>Cayphas,</hi> from <hi>Cayphas</hi> to <hi>Pilat,</hi> from <hi>Pilat</hi> to <hi>Herod,</hi> frō <hi>Herod</hi> to <hi>Pilat</hi> backe againe, from <hi>Pilat</hi> to mount <hi>Caluarie,</hi> in which last iourney he carried on his weake bodie his heauie Crosse, which must needs cause in him great thirst, no man all that time presenting him with so much as a cuppe of cold water.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Besides all this, his euacuation of blood that night and the next morning could not but cause extreame thirst. He swet blood in the Garden at all the pores of his bodie, so aboundantlie, that (as S. Luke saith (<hi>the blood tric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled downe to the ground;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luc. 22.</note> at the pillar also, where he receaued so many and so cruell lashes, he shed a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of blood; In his coronation with thornes no litle quantitie of blood distilled from his sacred head, no litle from his hands and feete, when they were nayled to the Crosse; and on the Crosse from his wounds of his hands
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:177141:110"/> and feete blood ranne continuallie, as from foure running fountaines, in so much that the vaines of his bodie (which like so many running riuers do water mans body) were almost quite emptied, and so all his body was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide of moisture, which made his mouth drie, and his tongue to cleaue to his mouth for want of moisture, Which could not but cause an extreame thirst. And therefore it is like that there was neuer man that had so much thirst as he, and yet liued. Yet this thirst he would suffer, to teach vs temperance and sobrietie, to satisfie for our too much pleasure, which we take in drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king delicious wines, to satisfie for our excesse in drinking &amp; euen for our drunkennesse.</p>
